## How to contribute to Mango

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Mango**, instead email us at <mailto:support@infiniteautomation.com>

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/infiniteautomation/ma-core-public/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/infiniteautomation/ma-core-public/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* Read more here about supplying appropriate information [Reporting Bugs] (https://help.infiniteautomation.com/reporting-bugs)

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Mango will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Forum](https://forum.infiniteautomation.com/category/6/wishlist) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Mango in the [Developer's Forum](https://forum.infiniteautomation.com/category/7/development-general-discussion).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Mango documentation?**

* Let us know in the [User Help Forum](https://forum.infiniteautomation.com/category/4/user-help).
